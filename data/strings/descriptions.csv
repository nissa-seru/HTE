# Ships,,,,,
drg_persephone,SHIP,"The Persephone is a fairly generic high-tech destroyer with an emphasis on heavy weaponry. Unlike many other ships of its era, the Persephone's bridge is buried deep inside its hull, eschewing windows in favor of improved survivability for command crews.",,,
drg_incursion,SHIP,"An expensive battlecruiser designed for use with faster cruiser fleets, the Incursion's oversized engines allow it to keep pace with cruisers, and its quintet of powerful EMP generators allow it to cripple its prey with ease.",,,
drg_iris,SHIP,"The Iris is a modern destroyer designed to provide defensive support to heavy capital fleets. Extremely specialized for this role, it is nearly impossible to kill unless separated from the larger ships it is responsible for guarding. Irises were designed to mount a heavy point-defense suite and fire-support missiles, though bold captains have been known to experiment with more radical loadouts. ",,,
drg_gila,SHIP,"The answer to the lack of a high-tech line cruiser, the Gila is designed to function as the core of any advanced fleet doctrine. Unlike other high-tech vessels, it was intended to serve alongside slow, heavy vessels like the Paragon, and prefers to simply absorb enemy firepower rather than dipping in and out of the battle lines. Gilas are fairly vulnerable without support, as their low maneuverability prevents them from bringing their enormous frontal guns to bear against small, fast-moving targets.",,,
drg_bombardier,SHIP,"The Bombardier-class cruiser was designed to provide massive missile strike power, able to flush all of its racks in seconds. However, its lack of larger missile mounts means that it expends its fearsome ordnance very quickly, and is left quite vulnerable in the face of high-grade point-defense grids.",,,
,,,,,
drg_aphelion,SHIP,"The Aphelion is a lighter, cheaper version of the popular Apogee. While it lacks the heavy weapons mounts of its larger cousin, it is extremely cheap to operate, and carries a robust active flare system that can intercept entire salvoes of missiles.",,,
drg_moray,SHIP,"A well-rounded high-tech destroyer, the Moray makes an effective line ship for light fleets, or a useful skirmisher for heavier fleets. In groups, it excels, as its phase skimmer allows it to easily disengage to vent flux while allies continue to pressure the target.

Development of the Moray-class destroyers began after the Second AI war as an attempt to bring hull designs from the revolutionary Tempest-class frigates up to the destroyer scale. Unfortunately, many aspects of the Tempest's design failed to scale up properly, and the internal systems had to be completely redesigned, putting the Moray into an entirely different role than intended. Despite the failure to achieve the initial design goals, the result was considered quite acceptable by military commanders.",,,
drg_tigershark,SHIP,"A cousin of the popular Aurora-class cruiser, the Tigershark eschews its sibling's plethora of small mounts in favor of larger and more flexible ordnance. Aside from a different form factor and mount layout, it is nearly identical to the Aurora, even using most of the same internal parts.",,,
drg_spire,SHIP,"A purpose-built front-line carrier, the Spire is designed to wade into the thick of battle, relying on endless fighter swarms to guard its flanks. To prevent the massive fighter pilot losses that would normally occur with these tactics, Spires make use of a specialized fighter automation nanofactory, allowing crewed fighters to be manufactured with drone systems instead.",,,
drg_peregrine,SHIP,"Despite its relatively few weapon mounts and complete lack of missiles, the Peregrine is a surprisingly powerful combatant thanks to a complex array of supercapacitors that overcharge energy-based weapons.",,,
drg_equality,SHIP,"Designed to serve as a fleet anchor when a Paragon is either unavailable or impractical, the Equality has an extremely powerful reactor core for its size. This excess of power allows it to mount several exotic subsystems designed to enhance combat performance, redirecting power to where it is most needed depending on the situation.

Often chosen as a flagship by high-ranking officers thanks to its spacious bridge (or perhaps its luxurious captain's quarters) rather than its combat capabilities, the Equality is nonetheless a highly capable warship. ",,,
drg_scute,SHIP,"Easily identified by its egg-shaped hull, the Scute is heavily armored and well-shielded.",,,
drg_gloom,SHIP,"The Gloom is a phase destroyer intended to fill a fleet support role rather than a direct combat role. It is primarily included in fleet doctrines for its Drive Field Compressor, which substantially improves fleet acceleration and maneuvering.",,,
drg_shoebill,SHIP,"Slow, heavy, and extremely durable, the Shoebill is vastly different from other high-tech ships. Popular theory holds that its design contract was written by those Domain admirals still sympathetic to the low-tech cause, and that it somehow snuck by the naval acquisitions board.",,,
,,,,,
# Fighters,,,,,
drg_khanjali,SHIP,A heavy fighter with a high-damage plasma weapon capable of shredding both enemy fighter squadrons and light warships.,,,
drg_kukri,SHIP,"A Dagger variant designed to carry a single Tawa-class standoff torpedo, Kukris are equally effective against both shields and armor. Their torpedoes split into a trio of unstable plasma spheroids when nearing their target, making interception difficult.",,,
drg_kaskara,SHIP,"Designed to permanently render low-tech doctrines obsolete, Kaskaras are some of the best anti-armor strikecraft available in the Persean Sector. Their minature High Intensity Laser fires in bursts and lacks the range of its larger cousin, but retains its brutal effectiveness against armor.",,,
drg_blaze,SHIP,"A unique drone fighter with a tiny phase coil, the Blaze can easily melt light targets with its miniaturized plasma streamer.

Size limitations mean that the Blaze's phase coil lacks most containment measures beyond those required to stop the fighter from immediately exploding. As a result, fighter chassis lifetimes are measured in minutes. Hanger crews typically self-destruct Blazes after combat rather than risk a phase coil destabilization while trying to recover a battle-damaged drone.",,,
drg_sheen,SHIP,"An autonomous interceptor drone, the Sheen is suitable for both point-defense duty and harassing lighter warships. Though it lacks a shield generator, it can be replaced extremely quickly.",,,
,,,,,
# Systems,,,,,
drg_microvent,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Rapidly vents flux for a very brief period, disabling weapons and shields. Re-engages shields when complete if they were on when the system was activated.",,,
drg_rangeoverclock,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Overclocks the ship's targeting systems and energy focusing arrays, doubling weapon range and severely reducing top speed. Generates significant amounts of hard flux while active, and requires time to cool down when deactivated. Cannot increase weapon range past 1500 units.",,,
drg_fluxcompressor,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Compresses a portion of the ship's flux and routes it through the engines, providing a burst of speed and maneuverability that quickly decays. The bonus increases with flux level, as more flux can be fed through the system.",,,
drg_hvb_system,SHIP_SYSTEM,Increases ballistic and energy weapon fire rates by 50% and reduces flux costs by 33%. Increases missile rate of fire by 100%.,,,
drg_subsystemrealignment,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Switches subsystem mode between Supercruise, Siege, and Bastion.",,,
drg_incursionsys,SHIP_SYSTEM,Rapidly strikes the target ship with powerful EMP arcs. Has a limited firing arc and prevents weapons use while active.,,,
drg_spiresys,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Instantly fabricates and launches replacement fighters, returning any wings to full strength.",,,
,,,,,
# Weapons,,,,,
drg_nyx,WEAPON,"Quad launcher capable of firing Atropos-class guided torpedoes with a quick reloading time. Less dangerous than Reaper salvos, but far more reliable. Carries generous ammunition to make up for its sub-par strike damage.

The Atropos torpedo is a large guided torpedo with an extended range. The AM-catalyzed nuclear warhead typically used in torpedo warheads is missing here as baryonic interference from the detonator would foul the guidance systems. It is replaced by a smaller, yet still potent chemical charge. ",,,
drg_alecto,WEAPON,"Dual launcher capable of firing Atropos-class guided torpedoes with a quick reloading time. Less dangerous than a Reaper, but much more reliable.

The Atropos torpedo is a large guided torpedo with an extended range. The AM-catalyzed nuclear warhead typically used in torpedo warheads is missing here as baryonic interference from the detonator would foul the guidance systems. It is replaced by a smaller, yet still potent chemical charge.",,,
drg_ahab,WEAPON,"A heavy launcher designed for Harpoon missiles, the Ahab relies on an advanced autoloader to provide a high volume of fire.

A departure from standard missile pod design, the Ahab only has a solitary launch tube. Fewer tubes to load means that reloading machinery can be greatly simplified, permitting faster autoloaders and expanded ammunition reserves.

These medium range missiles are identical to the ones fired from single or triple racks, and are a great way to finish off a ship with downed shields. Calibers vary, but are usually around 120mm. An excellent propulsion system delivers a large warhead to the target at sublight speeds. Sacrificing maneuverability for speed and warhead size, the medium range missile is one of the highest yield non strike weapons employed in the sector. One hit is almost fatal to frigate-sized ships. ",,,
drg_tawa_rack,WEAPON,"Dual rack holding Tawa standoff torpedoes. Tawa torpedoes produce a trio of unstable plasma spheroids and propel them at their target from a distance, avoiding point defenses.

Tawa standoff torpedoes utilize a trio of microfusion bombs and a single-use focusing lens to produce plasma-filled mini-universe anomalies identical to those of the formidable Plasma Cannon. The lack of active cooling and stabilization armatures results in much worse accuracy and range, but produces an instability in the anomaly that causes it to create a mild EMP effect on impact.",,,
drg_tawa_pod,WEAPON,"Launcher capable of firing pairs of Tawa standoff torpedoes from an internal magazine. Tawa torpedoes produce a trio of unstable plasma spheroids and propel them at their target from a distance, avoiding point defenses.

Tawa standoff torpedoes utilize a trio of microfusion bombs and a single-use focusing lens to produce plasma-filled mini-universe anomalies identical to those of the formidable Plasma Cannon. The lack of active cooling and stabilization armatures results in much worse accuracy and range, but produces an instability in the anomaly that causes it to create a mild EMP effect on impact.",,,
drg_tawa_battery,WEAPON,"Capital-grade rapid launcher capable of firing triplets of Tawa standoff torpedoes from a generous internal magazine. An advanced launching mechanism fires the torpedoes at close to their maximum velocity, reducing time-to-target.

Tawa standoff torpedoes utilize a trio of microfusion bombs and a single-use focusing lens to produce plasma-filled mini-universe anomalies identical to those of the formidable Plasma Cannon. The lack of active cooling and stabilization armatures results in much worse accuracy and range, but produces an instability in the anomaly that causes it to create a mild EMP effect on impact.",,,
drg_plp,WEAPON,"An extremely powerful strike weapon that fires homing plasma bolts with a punch-through effect.

Designed to replace torpedoes, the Plasma Lens Projector fires plasma bolts configured to produce an explosive lensing effect on contact. During formation, the bolt's resonant frequency is aligned with that of the target's reactor core, producing a magnetic reaction inside the projectile that guides it towards its target.",,,
drg_tpr_m,WEAPON,"One of the oldest energy weapons next to the laser, the Plasma Railgun uses electric fields to accelerate a tiny ring of plasma to a significant fraction of lightspeed. Though not as powerful as modern energy weapons, it has decent anti-armor performance for its efficiency, ensuring its continued use.",,,
drg_tpr_l,WEAPON,"A heavier, twin-barreled version of the Plasma Railgun. Longer and denser accelerator coils provide slightly improved range over its smaller cousin.",,,
drg_arc_s,WEAPON,"A minaturized version of the Arc Emitter, trading fire rate and damage for the ability to fit into a small mount. Its substantial charge time often means that interceptions occur perilously close to impact.",,,
drg_arc_m,WEAPON,"Arc Emitters use a poorly-understood gravitic reaction to catalyze a dielectric breakdown of spacetime, allowing the creation of electric arcs through the normally non-conductive vacuum of space. Unfortunately, this means that any arc must follow the path of least resistance, making target selection impossible beyond a brief IFF check.",,,
drg_arc_l,WEAPON,"A capital-sized Arc Emitter designed for maximum fire rate, arc potential, and EMP effects. Has a ruinous flux cost, but can leave entire squadrons of fighters crippled and drifting.",,,
drg_dissector,WEAPON,An integrated heavy phase beam intended for use on advanced salvage ships. Captains quickly realized that the beam made no distinction between lifeless hulks and crewed vessels.,,,
drg_kneecapper_s,WEAPON,A medium-range rocket designed to deliver a payload of high-energy ion bomblets at extended ranges. An integrated reloading system keeps the launcher topped up during long battles.,,,
drg_kneecapper_m,WEAPON,A twin launcher capable of firing two Kneecapper medium-range rockets at a time. Kneecapper MRRs deliver a payload of high-energy ion bomblets at extended ranges. An integrated reloading system keeps the launcher topped up during long battles.,,,
drg_flamer,WEAPON,"Projects a semi-coherent stream of highly charged plasma at targets, overwhelming shields and melting armor through sheer energy output.

Generally, military-grade shielding can easily repel dispersed particle weapons, and normally, a plasma flamethrower would be no exception. However, this starship version is designed to siphon off flux-charged plasma directly from a reactor core for use as ammunition. This allows a frankly horrifying energy output, as the weapon mount only needs to contain and project the plasma, rather than produce it itself. At these energies, the plasma stream can disrupt shields, though its dispersed nature means that a significant fraction of the energy can be absorbed as soft flux. Regardless, the weapon's raw output makes up for most of its deficiencies.

Technically, the plasma streamer isn't a flamethrower, since no combustion takes place in the plasma stream. However, it bears a clear aesthetic resemblance to old-fashioned fuel-burning flame weapons, and the terminology has stuck regardless of its technical accuracy.",,,

# Planets,,,,,
drg_svarog,CUSTOM,"Host to some of the largest independent shipyards in the sector, Svarog enjoys a healthy business relationship with major polities across the sector. The Luddic Path, of course, considers the planet's advanced industry an affront to God.",,"Svarog is an oddity, a habitable planet in the orbit of a collapsed star. Originally an lifeless ball of ice and rock, Domain terraforming projects turned the planet habitable, if a bit snowy. Unlike most habitable planets, Svarog is kept warm through the extreme tidal forces caused by the nearby black hole rather than solar radiation. While the light given off by the accretion disk is generally enough to see by, it cannot sustain most natural plant life. As a result, the planet is host to a variety of engineered low-light flora and fauna. Despite the habitable surface, nearly half the population lives in orbit, working at the massive orbital shipyards.",
