Integrated Supercapacitors,drg_supercaps,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.drgSupercaps,"This ship has an extensive array of fast-charging supercapacitors, cooling systems, and high-density conduits built into its weapon hardpoints. Projectile-based energy weapons fitted to this ship deal %s more damage, and beam weapons deal %s more damage. All energy weapons produce %s increased flux.",Energy weapon damage and flux cost is doubled.,graphics/hullmods/drg_supercaps.png
Fourth Battlegroup,drg_fourth,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.drgFourth,"Built to the specifications of the elite 4th Domain Battlegroup, this vessel is a prime example of the Domain Navy's 'invincible wall' doctrine, particularly exhibited by a series of exotic shield modifications performed using pre-Collapse industrial technology. This increases the ship's shield arc by %s and unfolding rate by %s, and reduces its upkeep by %s.  Oversized flux sinks additionally reduce shield damage taken by %s. Significant internal changes provide a %s bonus to OP budgets, but reduce hull and armor by %s. ","Increased shield arc and unfolding speed, decreased shield damage taken, upkeep cost, armor strength, and hull.",graphics/hullmods/drg_fourth.png
Harmonic Energy Projector,drg_harmproj,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.drgHarmProj,"This ship's integrated harmonic energy projector increases energy weapon range and projectile velocity as its flux level increases. The projector utilizes hard flux to catalyze the acceleration, and as such, cannot function without any hard flux buildup. The bonus scales with the current flux, up to a maximum of %s increased range and %s increased projectile velocity at %s flux.",Increased energy weapon range and projectile velocity as flux increases.,graphics/hullmods/drg_harmproj.png
Advanced Fighter Bays,drg_fighterbays,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.drgFighterBays,"This ship's avionics, hangar bays, and nanoforges are specifically optimized for fightercraft, taking %s less time to replace destroyed fighters and reducing pilot losses by %s. However, they cannot fabricate heavy weapons, %s.","Faster fighter refit time and reduced pilot loss rate, but OP cost for bombers is doubled.",graphics/hullmods/drg_fighterbays.png
Inefficient Ammo Feeders,drg_badammofeeder,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.drgBadAmmoFeeder,"While the Tigershark's large universal hardpoint is capable of interfacing with ballistic weapons, this feature was clearly an afterthought by engineers who scoffed at the idea of a high-tech ship using such archaic weapons. Ballistic weapons mounted to this ship have %s rate of fire, %s increased flux cost per shot, and %s range.","Ballistic weapons have increased flux cost, reduced RoF, and decreased range.",graphics/hullmods/drg_badammofeeder.png
PD Specialization,drg_pdspec,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.drgPDspec,"This ship is optimized for usage in a point-defense role, and recieves a flat %s unit increase to the range of all PD weapons. This system allows the use of additional targeting augmentations, but locks maximum weapon range to %s units.","PD range increased, other weapons are more expensive.",graphics/hullmods/drg_pdspec.png
Compact Missile Autoforge,drg_missileforge,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.drgMissileForge,Repurposed fighter nanoforges built into the ship's weapon hardpoints allow in-combat restocking of missile weapons. Regenerates %s (rounded up) of maximum missile ammo capacity every %s. Unaffected by increases or reductions to missile ammo capacity. Does not function with single-shot missiles.,Regenerates missile ammo over time.,graphics/hullmods/drg_missileforge.png
Covert Ops Refit,drg_covops,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.drgCovops,"A hideously expensive refit for ships intended to operate clandestinely in hostile space. Improved sensor packages increase sensor strength by %s, while an advanced stealth coating reduces sensor profile by %s. Upgraded engines increase top speed by %s, zero-flux speed bonus by %s, and allow it to apply at up to %s flux. These modifications collectively increase maintenance by %s.",Improved sensor strength and speed.,graphics/hullmods/drg_covops.png
Drive Field Compressor,drg_drivefield,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.drgDriveField,"An advanced variant of the Drive Field Stabilizer, the Drive Field Compressor improves fleet-wide engine performance by increasing the density of overlapping drive fields. Each ship with this hullmod installed increases the fleet's acceleration by %s (up to a maximum of %s), and reduces the fleet's detected-at range by %s (up to a maximum of %s). This stealth bonus does not apply when using Sustained Burn or Emergency Burn.

This system is fairly complex and requires constant maintenance, increasing monthly supply costs by %s.

The current fleetwide acceleration bonus is %s.",Increases fleetwide engine performance and reduces sensor profile.,graphics/hullmods/drg_drivefield.png
Advanced Energy Interface,drg_heavyenergyintegration,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.drgHeavyEnergyIntegration,Reduces the OP cost to fit large energy weapons by %s.,Reduces OP cost of large energy weapons.,graphics/hullmods/generic_mod.png
Advanced Weapons Interface,drg_heavyweaponintegration,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.drgHeavyWeaponsIntegration,"Reduces the OP cost to fit large energy weapons by %s, and large ballistic and missile weapons by %s.",Reduces OP cost of large energy and missile weapons.,graphics/hullmods/generic_mod.png
Adaptive Subsystems,drg_adaptivesystems,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.drgAdaptiveSubsystems,"This ship can switch to one of three modes, significantly enhancing its engines, weapons, or defenses. Effects require %s to reach full strength after changing modes.","Can swap modes to improve weapons, engines, or defenses.",graphics/hullmods/adaptive/adaptive_mod.png
