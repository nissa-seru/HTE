Integrated Supercapacitors,drg_supercaps,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.drgSupercaps,"This ship has an extensive array of fast-charging supercapacitors, cooling systems, and high-density conduits built into its weapon hardpoints. Projectile-based energy weapons fitted to this ship deal %s more damage, and beam weapons deal %s more damage. All energy weapons produce %s increased flux.",Energy weapon damage and flux cost is doubled.,graphics/hullmods/drg_supercaps.png
Fourth Battlegroup,drg_fourth,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.drgFourth,"This ship was constructed according to Domain 4th Battlegroup specifications. It is a prime specimen of the the Domain Navy's ""invincible wall"" fleet doctrine, particularly exhibited by a series of radical subsystem modifications (performed with pre-Collapse industrial methods) allowing highly efficient shield generators. This increases the ship's shield arc by %s and unfolding rate by %s, and reduces its upkeep by %s.  Oversized flux sinks additionally reduce shield damage taken by %s. Significant internal changes provide a %s bonus to OP budgets, but reduce hull and armor by %s. ","Increased shield arc and unfolding speed, decreased shield damage taken, upkeep cost, armor strength, and hull.",graphics/hullmods/drg_fourth.png
Harmonic Energy Projector,drg_harmproj,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.drgHarmProj,"This ship's integrated harmonic energy projector increases energy weapon range and projectile velocity as its flux level increases. The projector utilizes hard flux to catalyze the acceleration, and as such, cannot function without any hard flux buildup. The bonus scales with the current flux, up to a maximum of %s increased range and %s increased projectile velocity at %s flux.",Increased energy weapon range and projectile velocity as flux increases.,graphics/hullmods/drg_harmproj.png
Advanced Fighter Bays,drg_fighterbays,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.drgFighterBays,"This ship's avionics, hangar bays, and nanoforges are specifically optimized for fightercraft, taking %s less time to replace destroyed fighters and reducing pilot losses by %s. However, they are not designed to handle the heavy ordnance carried by bombers, and require significant refit to do so, increasing OP costs of such craft by %s.","Faster fighter refit time and reduced pilot loss rate, but OP cost for bombers is doubled.",graphics/hullmods/drg_fighterbays.png
Inefficient Ammo Feeders,drg_badammofeeder,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.drgBadAmmoFeeder,"While the Tigershark's large universal hardpoint is capable of interfacing with ballistic weapons, this feature was clearly an afterthought by engineers who scoffed at the idea of a high-tech ship using such archaic weapons. Ballistic weapons mounted to this ship have %s rate of fire, %s increased flux cost per shot, and %s range.","Ballistic weapons have increased flux cost, reduced RoF, and decreased range.",graphics/hullmods/drg_badammofeeder.png
PD Specialization,drg_pdspec,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.drgPDspec,"This ship is optimized for usage in a point-defense role, and recieves a flat %s increase to the range of all PD weapons. Mounting non-PD weapons (other than missiles) requires significant internal reconfiguration, and costs %s extra OP. Incompatible with Integrated Targeting Unit and Dedicated Targeting Core.","PD range increased, other weapons are more expensive.",graphics/hullmods/drg_pdspec.png
