Integrated Supercapacitors,drg_supercaps,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.drgSupercaps,"This ship has an extensive array of fast-charging supercapacitors and cooling systems built in to its weapon hardpoints. Any modular energy weapons installed on this ship deal %s increased damage. These dedicated systems provide significantly improved flux efficiency, only increasing flux cost by %s despite the much larger damage boost.",Energy weapon damage and flux cost is doubled.,graphics/hullmods/drg_supercaps.png
Fourth Battlegroup,drg_fourth,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.drgFourth,"This ship was constructed according to Domain 4th Battlegroup specifications. It is a prime specimen of the the Domain Navy's ""invincible wall"" fleet doctrine, particularly exhibited by a series of radical subsystem modifications (performed with pre-Collapse industrial methods) allowing highly efficient shield generators. This increases the ship's shield arc by %s and unfolding rate by %s, and reduces its upkeep by %s.  Oversized flux sinks additionally reduce shield damage taken by %s. Significant internal changes provide a %s bonus to OP budgets, but reduce hull and armor by %s. ","Increased shield arc and unfolding speed, decreased shield damage taken, upkeep cost, armor strength, and hull.",graphics/hullmods/drg_fourth.png
