drg_persephone,SHIP,"The Persephone is a fairly generic high-tech destroyer with an emphasis on heavy weaponry. Unlike many other ships of its era, the Persephone's bridge is buried deep inside its hull, eschewing windows in favor of improved survivability for command crews.",,,
drg_incursion,SHIP,"A high-tech redesign of the reliable Onslaught, the Incursion forms the hammer to the Paragon's anvil, sporting a powerful drive core and heavy frontal armament. Incursions utilize an exact copy of the Paragon's flux reactor, though the similarities end there. They are fast, violent, and aggressive; designed for a hunter-killer role, they excel at picking off isolated vessels, but will falter if faced with a proper battle line.",,,
drg_iris,SHIP,"The Iris is a modern destroyer designed to provide defensive support to heavy capital fleets. Extremely specialized for this role, it is nearly impossible to kill unless separated from the larger ships it is responsible for guarding. Irises were designed to mount a heavy point-defense suite and fire-support missiles, though bold captains have been known to experiment with more radical loadouts. ",,,
drg_gila,SHIP,"The answer to the lack of a high-tech line cruiser, the Gila is designed to function as the core of any advanced fleet doctrine. Unlike other high-tech vessels, it was intended to serve alongside slow, heavy vessels like the Paragon, and prefers to simply absorb enemy firepower rather than dipping in and out of the battle lines. Gilas are fairly vulnerable without support, as their low maneuverability prevents them from bringing their enormous frontal guns to bear against small, fast-moving targets.",,,
drg_bombardier,SHIP,"Employing a substantial array of missile hardpoints, a missile autoforge, and an advanced fire-direction system, the Bombardier-class cruiser provides valuable missile support. To reduce the ship's logistical profile, it uses sub-par shield emitters and engines, but this is rarely a concern for a ship that is not likely to see heavy front-line combat. Bombardiers can deploy an awe-inspiring amount of ordnance in a very short time, but suffer from a lack of speed and firepower after expending their ammunition.",,,
drg_aggressor,SHIP,"Effectively a pared-down version of the venerable Onslaught-class battleship, the Aggressor-class battlecruiser blurs the line between heavy cruiser and true capital. While it has the power supply, engines, and electronics systems of a capital warship, it is only slightly larger than most cruisers. However, its capital-grade engine core gives it an excellent power-to-weight ratio for a low low-tech warship, granting it above-average maneuverability and speed.",,,
drg_aphelion,SHIP,"The Aphelion is a lighter, cheaper version of the popular Apogee. While it lacks the heavy weapons mounts of its larger cousin, it is extremely cheap to operate, and carries a robust active flare system that can intercept entire salvoes of missiles.",,,
drg_moray,SHIP,"A well-rounded high-tech destroyer, the Moray makes an effective line ship for light fleets, or a useful skirmisher for heavier fleets. In groups, it excels, as its phase skimmer allows it to easily disengage to vent flux while allies continue to pressure the target.

Development of the Moray-class destroyers began after the Second AI war as an attempt to bring hull designs from the revolutionary Tempest-class frigates up to the destroyer scale. Unfortunately, many aspects of the Tempest's design failed to scale up properly, and the internal systems had to be completely redesigned, putting the Moray into an entirely different role than intended. Despite the failure to achieve the initial design goals, the result was considered quite acceptable by military commanders.",,,
drg_tigershark,SHIP,"While not visually similar, the Tigershark's internal systems are practically identical to those of the Aurora, much to the consternation of engineers and logistics officers responsible for keeping the ship in working order. In the hands of an aggressive captain, the ship is an excellent hunter-killer, easily eliminating smaller vessels and pinning larger ships against the battle line.",,,
drg_flamingo,SHIP,"A highly flexible heavy cruiser intended to serve as an anchor for a variety of subcapital fleet doctrines. The Flamingo is tough, slow, and reliable, with reinforced subsystems to allow a longer operating time than most other high-tech vessels of its size.

To the consternation of many Tritachyon captains and fleet commanders, the Flamingo-class has been renamed multiple times over its service life due to a plethora of trademark infringement lawsuits. Betting pools seem to indicate that the class will likely be renamed yet again within the next ten years.",,,
drg_spire,SHIP,"The Spire-class battlecarrier is designed to serve as a faster, more logistically efficient hybrid of the Paragon and the Astral. Its primary role is that of a direct-fire warship, carrying capital-grade armament with four strikecraft wings to engage smaller foes, or harass large ones. It carries specially-designed autofactories to maintain its fighter wings, ensuring that a suffcient density of strikecraft can be maintained, even in the heavy point-defense environments of the battle line. A Spire's pilots are significantly more likely to be shot down than any other capital carrier, but those that do are also much more likely to survive the ordeal, thanks to its advanced avionics package and powerful threat-detection systems.",,,
drg_peregrine,SHIP,"Despite its relatively few weapon mounts and complete lack of missiles, the Peregrine is a surprisingly powerful combatant thanks to a complex array of supercapacitors that overcharge energy-based weapons.

Originally designed as a light skirmisher in the same style as the Falcon, captains quickly realized that the Peregrine's armament was fairly lackluster, with a lack of missile hardpoints making it difficult to finish off overloaded opponents. In response, Tri-Tachyon engineers returned the ship to the drawing board, drastically redesigning the interior of the ship. Updated automated systems reduced the volume required for crew quarters, which allowed engineers to cram the ship full of capital-grade supercapacitors and cooling systems. These systems provided an enormous increase to maximum weapon damage output, while only mildly increasing overall flux costs for firing them. These (at the time) cutting-edge systems had the unfortunate side effect of decreasing dissipation rates, which meant that the engineers at the Tri-Tachyon design department had an excuse to cram yet another exotic device into the ship: a flux compressor. The system somewhat compensates for the weak flux systems, allowing the ship to instantly reduce its flux level by a sizeable amount, though it has a lengthy recharge time. All in all, the Peregrine came out as a fairly decent, if odd, medium cruiser, though it is notoriously flimsy if it can be caught out of position. As Peregrine captains prefer to say, ""helldunk or turbofeed, nothing in between"".",,,
drg_equality,SHIP,"Designed to serve as a fleet anchor when a Paragon is either unavailable or impractical, Equality-class battleships have an extremely powerful reactor core for their size. This excess of power allows them to mount several exotic subsystems designed to enhance combat performance, redirecting power to where it is most needed depending on the situation.

Often chosen as a flagship by high-ranking officers thanks to its spacious bridge (or perhaps its luxurious captain's quarters) rather than its combat capabilities, the Equality is nonetheless a highly capable warship. ",,,
drg_scute,SHIP,"Easily identified by its egg-shaped hull, the Scute is heavily armored and well-shielded. It pays for this with speed, and relies on its flux compressor to escape sticky situations or finish off weakened foes.",,,
drg_gloom,SHIP,"The Gloom is a phase cruiser intended to fill a fleet support role rather than a direct combat role. While perfectly functional as a combat ship, it is primarily included in fleet doctrines for its Drive Field Compressor, which substantially improves fleet acceleration and maneuvering.",,,
drg_rangeoverclock,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Overclocks the ship's targeting systems and energy focusing arrays, doubling weapon range and severely reducing top speed. Generates significant amounts of hard flux while active, and requires time to cool down when deactivated. Cannot increase weapon range past 1600 units.",,,
drg_fluxcompressor,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Compresses a portion of the ship's flux and routes it through the engines, providing a burst of speed and maneuverability that quickly decays. The bonus increases with flux level, as more flux can be fed through the system.",,,
drg_hvb_system,SHIP_SYSTEM,Increases ballistic and energy weapon fire rates by 50% and reduces flux costs by 33%. Increases missile rate of fire by 100%.,,,
drg_subsystemrealignment,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Switches subsystem mode between Supercruise, Siege, and Bastion.",,,
drg_nyx,WEAPON,"Quad launcher capable of firing Atropos-class guided torpedoes with a quick reloading time. Less dangerous than Reaper salvos, but far more reliable. Carries generous ammunition to make up for its sub-par strike damage.

The Atropos torpedo is a large guided torpedo with an extended range. The AM-catalyzed nuclear warhead typically used in torpedo warheads is missing here as baryonic interference from the detonator would foul the guidance systems. It is replaced by a smaller, yet still potent chemical charge. ",,,
drg_alecto,WEAPON,"Dual launcher capable of firing Atropos-class guided torpedoes with a quick reloading time. Less dangerous than a Reaper, but much more reliable.

The Atropos torpedo is a large guided torpedo with an extended range. The AM-catalyzed nuclear warhead typically used in torpedo warheads is missing here as baryonic interference from the detonator would foul the guidance systems. It is replaced by a smaller, yet still potent chemical charge.",,,
drg_ahab,WEAPON,"A heavy launcher designed for Harpoon missiles, the Ahab relies on an advanced autoloader to provide a high volume of fire.

A departure from standard missile pod design, the Ahab only has a solitary launch tube. Fewer tubes to load means that reloading machinery can be greatly simplified, permitting faster autoloaders and expanded ammunition reserves.

These medium range missiles are identical to the ones fired from single or triple racks, and are a great way to finish off a ship with downed shields. Calibers vary, but are usually around 120mm. An excellent propulsion system delivers a large warhead to the target at sublight speeds. Sacrificing maneuverability for speed and warhead size, the medium range missile is one of the highest yield non strike weapons employed in the sector. One hit is almost fatal to frigate-sized ships. ",,,
drg_tawa_rack,WEAPON,"Dual rack holding Tawa standoff torpedoes. Tawa torpedoes produce a trio of unstable plasma spheroids and propel them at their target from a distance, avoiding point defenses.

Tawa standoff torpedoes utilize a trio of microfusion bombs and a single-use focusing lens to produce plasma-filled mini-universe anomalies identical to those of the formidable Plasma Cannon. The lack of active cooling and stabilization armatures results in much worse accuracy and range, but produces an instability in the anomaly that causes it to create a mild EMP effect on impact.",,,
drg_tawa_pod,WEAPON,"Launcher capable of firing pairs of Tawa standoff torpedoes from an internal magazine. Tawa torpedoes produce a trio of unstable plasma spheroids and propel them at their target from a distance, avoiding point defenses.

Tawa standoff torpedoes utilize a trio of microfusion bombs and a single-use focusing lens to produce plasma-filled mini-universe anomalies identical to those of the formidable Plasma Cannon. The lack of active cooling and stabilization armatures results in much worse accuracy and range, but produces an instability in the anomaly that causes it to create a mild EMP effect on impact.",,,
drg_tawa_battery,WEAPON,"Capital-grade rapid launcher capable of firing triplets of Tawa standoff torpedoes from a generous internal magazine. An advanced launching mechanism fires the torpedoes at close to their maximum velocity, reducing time-to-target.

Tawa standoff torpedoes utilize a trio of microfusion bombs and a single-use focusing lens to produce plasma-filled mini-universe anomalies identical to those of the formidable Plasma Cannon. The lack of active cooling and stabilization armatures results in much worse accuracy and range, but produces an instability in the anomaly that causes it to create a mild EMP effect on impact.",,,
drg_plp,WEAPON,"An extremely powerful strike weapon designed to replace torpedoes, the Plasma Lens Projector fires plasma bolts configured to produce an explosive lensing effect on contact. During formation, the bolt's resonant frequency is aligned with that of the target's reactor core, producing a magnetic reaction inside the projectile that guides it towards its target.",,,
drg_tpr_m,WEAPON,"One of the oldest energy weapons next to the laser, the Toroidal Plasma Railgun uses electric fields to accelerate a tiny ring of plasma to a significant fraction of lightspeed. Though not as powerful as modern energy weapons, it has excellent range and decent anti-armor performance, ensuring its continued use.",,,
drg_tpr_l,WEAPON,"A heavier, twin-barreled version of the Toroidal Plasma Railgun. Longer and denser accelerator coils provide slightly improved range and flux efficiency over its smaller cousin.",,,
drg_arc_s,WEAPON,"A minaturized version of the Arc Emitter, trading fire rate and damage for the ability to fit into a small mount. Its substantial charge time often means that interceptions occur perilously close to impact.",,,
drg_arc_m,WEAPON,"Arc Emitters use a poorly-understood gravitic reaction to catalyze a dielectric breakdown of spacetime, allowing the creation of electric arcs through the normally non-conductive vacuum of space. Unfortunately, this means that any arc must follow the path of least resistance, making target selection impossible beyond a brief IFF check.",,,
drg_arc_l,WEAPON,"A capital-sized Arc Emitter designed for maximum fire rate, arc potential, and EMP effects. Has a ruinous flux cost, but can leave entire squadrons of fighters crippled and drifting.",,,
drg_dissector,WEAPON,An integrated heavy phase beam intended for use on advanced salvage ships. Captains quickly realized that the beam made no distinction between lifeless hulks and crewed vessels.,,,
drg_kneecapper_s,WEAPON,A medium-range rocket designed to deliver a payload of high-energy ion bomblets at extended ranges. An integrated reloading system keeps the launcher topped up during long battles.,,,
drg_kneecapper_m,WEAPON,A twin launcher capable of firing two Kneecapper medium-range rockets at a time. Kneecapper MRRs deliver a payload of high-energy ion bomblets at extended ranges. An integrated reloading system keeps the launcher topped up during long battles.,,,
drg_khanjali,SHIP,A heavy fighter with a high-damage plasma weapon capable of shredding both enemy fighter squadrons and light warships.,,,
drg_kukri,SHIP,"A Dagger variant designed to carry a single Tawa-class standoff torpedo, Kukris are equally effective against both shields and armor. Their torpedoes split into a trio of unstable plasma spheroids when nearing their target, making interception difficult.",,,
drg_kaskara,SHIP,"Designed to permanently render low-tech doctrines obsolete, Kaskaras are some of the best anti-armor strikecraft available in the Persean Sector. Their minature High Intensity Laser fires in bursts and lacks the range of its larger cousin, but retains its brutal effectiveness against armor.",,,
drg_svarog,CUSTOM,"Host to some of the largest independent shipyards in the sector, Svarog enjoys a healthy business relationship with major polities across the sector. The Luddic Path, of course, considers the planet's advanced industry an affront to God.",,"Svarog is an oddity, a habitable planet in the orbit of a collapsed star. Originally an lifeless ball of ice and rock, Domain terraforming projects turned the planet habitable, if a bit snowy. Unlike most habitable planets, Svarog is kept warm through the extreme tidal forces caused by the nearby black hole rather than solar radiation. While the light given off by the accretion disk is generally enough to see by, it cannot sustain most natural plant life. As a result, the planet is host to a variety of engineered low-light flora and fauna. Despite the habitable surface, nearly half the population lives in orbit, working at the massive orbital shipyards.",
