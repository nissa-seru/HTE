1.1.2

Now requires MagicLib.

New:
- Weapon: Plasma Lens Projector. Large energy. Fires a slow, weakly-guided projectile that deals significant HE damage in a line if it connects with the target's hull. Holds two charges, and reloads one every 10 seconds. Nearly unusable against small, fast targets. Synergizes extremely well with autopulses. Known by Tritachyon.

Changes:
- Name changes to deconflict with other mods and adhere better to vanilla naming patterns.
-- Invader -> Aggressor
-- Wyvern -> Khanjali
- Name changes are display-name only, hull and weapon IDs won't change until a future patch. No sense in breaking saves if I don't have to.
- Wyvern (now Khanjali): Weapons no longer generate flux. Its Plasma Catapult now has a slow-reloading four-shot magazine and a fast rate of fire. Active flares are now shot forwards instead of to the sides, but the total number of flares has been reduced. Added two IR Pulse Lasers (high-delay). Speed reduced slightly. Shield is now frontal instead of omni, and arc has been reduced.
- Variants modified to account for changes and additions.
- New ships and items added to whitelists for Industrial Evolution and Vesperon Combine.

Nerfs:
- Incursion: Synergy slots converted to missile slots and turret arcs adjusted to reduce forward convergence. Maximum convergence is now 3 large energies, 3 medium energies, and 5 small energies. No more 9 graviton beams on a single target. System changed to Plasma Burn instead of Plasma Thrusters to reduce its ability to escape sticky situations. Maneuverability and flux capacity increased to compensate somewhat. It should now be significantly more dangerous to over-commit.


Buffs:
- Persephone: OP increased by 12.
- Moray: DP decreased to 9 (from 10).
- Iris: Has now been released from the PD jail. PD specialization no longer penalizes non-PD weapons and is compatible with DTC/ITU, but caps maximum weapon range at 1200 units. OP increased by 10.
- Kingfisher: Improved the AI's usage of Targeting Overclock.

1.1.1
Fixed an error that made the Ahab, Nyx, and Tawa Battery rare exploration drops only. Now the Ahab is part of the missile blueprint package, and the Nyx and Tawa Battery are known by Tritachyon.

1.1.0 Release

This WILL break your save if you have a previous version of HTE installed. It will not break your save if you do not, and can be installed into an existing save.
(It also shouldn't break your save if there aren't any Kingfishers in your fleet or AI fleets, but no guarantees on that. If you have the most recent beta version, your save will also be fine.)

The mod now requires Lazylib.

Highlights: New capital warship, six new weapons, two new fighters, lots of Balance(tm). And by balance, I mean nerfs.
Patch notes are changes from 1.0.

New:
- Ship: Inequality-class battlecruiser, and its Battlegroup IV variant. It has a funky diagonal broadside and a built-in unique hullmod.
- Weapon: Alecto Atropos Launcher. Medium missile. Holds 6 shots of 2 torpedoes. Good choice when reliability is more important than sheer damage. Reload time is just barely fast enough to hit a target with a follow-up salvo if your first overloads it.
- Weapon: Nyx Atropos Salvo. Large missile. Has a very good fire rate, though not quite as good as the Hammer Barrage. Holds 8 shots of 4 torpedoes. Good choice if you're willing to sacrifice the damage and speed of a Hammer Barrage for homing projectiles and more ammo.
- Weapon: Ahab Harpoon Barrage. Large missile. Has a slow fire rate. Holds 6 shots of 9 missiles. It's 9 harpoons every 18 seconds. What more do you want?
- Weapon: Tawa Standoff Torpedoes. These torpedoes detonate into a trio of unstable plasma spheroids at the edge of point defense range, making them extremely difficult to intercept. Comes in a dual rack (small), dual launcher (medium, 4 shots of 2 torpedos), and triple launcher (large, 10 shots of 3 torpedos) variant. A good general-purpose weapon, but inefficient compared to anti-shield or anti-armor missiles. Struggles against small, fast, or narrow targets. Costs 5/12/30 OP.
- Fighter: Kukri Bomber Wing. A Trident bomber wing rebuilt to carry Tawa torpedoes. Generally better than Tridents by themselves, but not better than a Trident/Longbow combo, especially against heavily armored targets. Costs 28 OP. 
- Fighter: Wyvern Strike Fighter. Carries a Plasma Catapult (a short-range, low-damage version of the Plasma Cannon) and two active flares. Great armor penetration (for a fighter) and a decent shield, but it will quickly stress its flux when firing. Costs 20 OP.

Nerfs:
- Overall: Most ships had their shield upkeep slightly increased to match vanilla values.
- Tigershark: Now has practically identical stats to the Aurora, instead of being better in most regards, and got a builtin hullmod that gives it a penalty to ballistic range, rof, and efficiency. Large ballistics should remain a good choice, but shouldn't be the optimal choice in all scenarios. Shield radius has been increased to prevent clipping with the forward large hardpoint.
- Kingfisher: Lost its two medium missile hardpoints, lost 20 OP, had its flux stats reduced, and has been given a new ship system, Targeting Overclock. This system is a toggle (though it cannot be immediately reactivated), and doubles the range of all energy weapons while active (up to a cap), but generates significant amounts of hard flux and reduces speed by two-thirds. DP reduced to 30. Turn speed increased, though it's still the slowest-turning cruiser in the mod.
- Aphelion: Fuel capacity and fuel/ly reduced; range is the same. Shield ratio increased to 0.7 to match the Apogee.
- Incursion: Max turn speed, top speed, and turn acceleration reduced. OP reduced by 20.
- Iris: Speed and flux stats reduced. DP increased to 12. Removed prior builtin hullmods. OP reduced by 5. Now has a builtin hullmod that increases PD range significantly, but blocks ITU/DTC and has a hefty penalty for mounting non-missile and non-PD weapons. PPT reduced to 300 seconds, but now has Hardened Subsystems built in. Shield radius increased slightly. You can still use it for things other than point defense, but it won't be nearly as good at it.
- Invader: Apparently only cost 30 DP to deploy. This was a mistake, and it has been increased to the intended 36 DP. Speed slightly reduced. The XIV variant got 5 extra OP.
- Spire: DP increased to 50, flux stats reduced, turn speed reduced, OP reduced, builtin hullmods removed and replaced with a weaker custom builtin hullmod.
- Gila: OP reduced by 12, flux capacity and shield radius increased slightly, speed reduced slightly.
- Bombardier: Shield arc increased a smidge, since it's such a wide boy. Reduced OP by 10 and adjusted turret arcs. This is a buff. (It's not)

Changes:
- Overall: Fleet point changes to balance AI usage. Cargo, crew, and fuel capacity have been adjusted on most ships.
- Overall: Changes to PPT and CR recovery. "Line" ships (Kingfisher, Gila) get an extra minute of PPT to make up for their slow speed, and lose less CR from deployment (and thus recover faster). Other ships have been normalized to standard values for their size and tech level.
- Spawning: The Tigershark has been removed from the high-tech BP pool and made a rare BP; independents will still use it, but very rarely. The chance of Battlegroup IV ships spawning in independent fleets has been reduced, and they will no longer use Spires. Tri-Tachyon will use Spires and Incursions less frequently, and has a better chance of spawning IV variants of all ships. (though they don't use direct-fire warships much so they'll still be fairly rare)
- Moray: Mild flux nerfs, 2 more OP. Has slightly less shield upkeep than the Persephone, and loses less CR from deployment. Increased rear small turret arc by a lot.
- Persephone: Mild flux nerfs, 2 more OP. Costs 11 DP (from 10). 
- Peregrine: Has been given a new ship system, Flux Compressor. When activated, it instantly vents a sizeable fraction of your soft flux and a small fraction of your hard flux, and gives you a brief movement bonus that decays over time. Disposing of more flux with the system increases the bonus significantly, but not the duration. Dissipation has been slightly reduced to make it more reliant on its system. Integrated Supercapacitors has had its damage bonus reduced slightly to 66%, and now has a significantly weaker effect on beams. Base speed, acceleration, and shield arc slightly increased.
- Many updates to variants.
- Added some loading tips. Only one of them is threatening.

Buffs:
- Spire sprite redone a bit. It's still a flat wide boy, but the shading isn't as horrific. This is a buff.
- Fourth Battlegroup had its hullmod values adjusted. Now provides 7% reduced shield damage taken (from 5%) and -5% hull and armor (from -7%).
